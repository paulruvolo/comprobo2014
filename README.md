## Computational Robotics 2014 ##

This is the base repository for CompRobo.  You should fork this repository as part of setting up your development environment.  You will use your forked repository to both turn in your assignments, as well as fetch upstream changes from the base repo.

This class is now over.  This repo will be retired in favor of a new repo for the next iteration of the class (which will almost definitely be in Fall of 2015).
